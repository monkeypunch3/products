Start Screen Saver
==================

    Start Screen Saver is an application for easily starting the screen saver. All you do is click the icon. 
    Once the screen saver has started the program exits. 

    Note: Do not move your mouse while the screen saver is trying to start. It will try for about 5 seconds to 
    start the screen saver before giving up. If that happens you can press the start screen saver button 
    that will appear close the app and start again. 
    
    The application will automatically close after about ten seconds if the screen saver started successfully. 
    If it didn't start, let's say you are moving the mouse constantly, the application will stay open until you close it.

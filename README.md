Export Image to Multiple Sizes for Photoshop  
Export to Multiple Sizes is a script for Photoshop to export your work to multiple sizes. When creating icons for mobile or desktop applications you must export your application icon to over twenty five different sizes. Now you can choose a target platform (or create your own sizes list) and export them all at once!
